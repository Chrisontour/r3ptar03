# r3ptar Mission 03
## project content

For some time it is possible to program the Lego EV3 with Python.
In this project I try to convert the existing graphical codes of the EV3 projects into Python. 
I started with the incredible R3PTAR.

## how to use it on your EV3
1. follow the "Program in Python with EV3" how-to steps: https://education.lego.com/en-us/product-resources/mindstorms-ev3/teacher-resources/python-for-ev3
(watch the videos to see the steps for creating the sd-card and the visual studio code installation)
2. build the R3PTAR Modell for Mission 03 (https://www.lego.com/cdn/product-assets/product.bi.additional.extra.pdf/31313_X_R3PTAR.pdf) 
3. start the EV3 brick with sd-card mounted and usb-wired
4. start visual studio code, go to the ev3 function in vs-code and connect to the brick (like seen in the video of step one)
5. copy the main.py code into your vs-code project and save it (must be named main.py)
6. press F5 to transfer it to the EV3 - it starts immediately - so be careful with the usb-wire (unwire it and set the R3PTAR to the floor for best results ;-) )
